# art-not-art

this is a repo for a project exploring the nature of neural networks and
recognition of art objects.

why p5/ml5?
while i am learning python for other purposes and tensorflow could be the proper tool for this eventually,
my aim is to develop this project as a pwa(progressive web app).

current status:
discovering apis with images for use in training models using ml5
